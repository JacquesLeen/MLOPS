# BP for Coding in a cloud environment

* Create virtual environment for each project
    ```
    virtualenv ~/.venv     
    source ~/.venv/bin/activate    
    which python
    ```
* Make sure that your bashrc file is accessible directly from different terminal windows. Access your bashrc file
    ```
    vim ~/.bashrc
    ```
    after that you can add a source command to the file
    ```bash
    source ~/.venv/bin/activate
    ```
